# IOT-Water-System

This is an IOT-based Water Management system. It can monitor the water level in sumps and tanks, which is in turn integrated with a fresh water supply system. Human intervention is made minimal and optimal usage of time is ensured. The entire circuits have been voltage regulated as well for longevity of the model. The control panel side acts as the brain of the entire automated operation. Subsequent messages are shown on a screen by the use of control panel.

### Objective:

The objective of the prototype is to monitor water levels in real-time as well as to automate the process of refilling water in tanks and sumps, eliminating human intervention. It also has the provision to alert the required personnel when water touches or goes below a predefined level. 

### Brief Outline:

In our IoT water management system, water level sensors are installed in the tanks and sumps to continuously monitor the water level. These sensors send the collected data to an ESP32 microcontroller-based control panel via Bluetooth. The control panel processes this data and can autonomously control the water refilling system based on pre-defined conditions. A React Native mobile application serves as the user interface, displaying real-time water level statistics and enabling users to remotely manage features like automatic refilling, tracking time to refill water and so on.
