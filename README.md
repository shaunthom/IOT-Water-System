# IOT-Water-System
It is an IOT-based Water Management system, aimed at instilling a behavior for resource consumption monitoring. In addition, it brings in IoT Logistics Tracking into public water management to recede the possibility of corruption. It could monitor the water level in sumps and tanks, which is in turn integrated with a fresh water supply system. Human intervention is made minimal and optimal usage of time is ensured. The entire circuits have been voltage regulated as well for longevity of the model. The control panel side acts as the brain of the entire automated operation. A display module could also be connected and subsequent messages would be shown on the screen by the use of control panel.
